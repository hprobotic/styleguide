      <div id="toc"></div>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
      This docment is a guide on how to write React applications at TravelPerk.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Setup a Project</h2>

      <p>
      Create you React projects using <em><a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app">Create React App</a></em> this will give you a solid starting point and free upgrades.
      Don't <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#converting-to-a-custom-setup">eject</a> unless you have a good reason for doing so.
      If you want to eject check with the rest of the team first.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Tools</h3>

      <p>
      Once you have your project setup with Create React App you will still need some extra configuration.
      </p>

      <h4>Node.js and npm</h4>

      <p>
      Make sure your specify your <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> version in an <code>.nvmrc</code> for <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a> users.
      </p>
      <p>
      Try to use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/"><code>npm</code></a> over <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/"><code>yarn</code></a>. They are both great package managers but
      keeping the same version of <code>npm</code> among all developers in a team is easier than doing the same with <code>yarn</code>.
      </p>

      <h4>Flow</h4>

      <p>
      We try to type-check all our JavaScript files using <a href="https://flow.org/">Flow</a>. To install Flow you can simply follow the <a href="https://flow.org/en/docs/install/">installation guide</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      It's recommended that you execute <a href="https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed"><code>flow-typed</code></a> after you setup Flow and every time you install, remove or update a node module.
      </p>

      <h4>Prettier</h4>

      <p>
      Instead of having an extensive style guide dissecting where to put each and every white space we prefer to use <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a> for automatically format the code.
      </p>

      <p>
      Make sure  you follow the <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier#pre-commit-hook-for-changed-files">official documentation</a> so that Prettier runs automatically for every new commit.
      </p>

      <h3>Folder Structure</h3>

      <p>
      Follow the folder structure made by Create React App as much as possible. That means keeping all your configuration files in the root folder and all the code in <code>src</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Inside <code>src/</code> you're going to have a structure similar to the following:
      <pre>
src
├── api
├── app
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── screens
│   │   ├── Login
│   │   └── Settings
│   │       └── screens
│   │           ├── Addresses
│   │           │   └── components
│   │           └── Users
│   │               └── components
│   └── shared
│       └── Header
├── styles
├── types
├── utils
├── index.js
└── setupTests.js
      </pre>
      <p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>api/</code></dt>
        <dd>
        Contains all the modules that make API requests
        </dd>
        <dt><code>app/</code></dt>
        <dd>
        Contains the whole app
        </dd>
        <dt><code>styles/</code></dt>
        <dd>
        Contains JavaScript modules with styling information. This folder may not be needed for some projects.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>types/</code></dt>
        <dd>
        Contains the Flow definitions for types that are not specified by <code>flow-typed</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>utils/</code></dt>
        <dd>
        Any utility module goes here.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>index.js</code></dt>
        <dd>
        The main JavaScript files that bootstraps the whole application
        </dd>
        <dt><code>setupTests.js</code></dt>
        <dd>
        A file that gets executed before the tests are launched.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
      All the static files that are not imported via JavaScript&mdash;e.g. <code>index.html</code>, favicons&mdash;are placed in the <code>public/</code> folder.
      </p>

      <h2>Code Style</h2>

      <p>
      As said code formatting is left to Prettier, there are also some <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> rules that are automatically set by Create React App. At the time of writing
      is not possible to configure custom ESLint rules without ejecting from Create React App.
      </p>

      <p>
      Following some advices on how to write JavaScript code so that is more readable.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Prefer <code>const</code> over <code>let</code>. Code written with constants is often more readable</li>
        <li>
          Never use comments to describe what the code is doing.
          The code should be easy to read and understand, comments are good to explain why you wrote code is a certain why but not to clarify what's going on in the program.
          Consider the following examples.

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Gpx/59ce150791db7c354fef717faefee87e.js"></script>
        </li>
      </ul>
